# Project Plan: Automated Warehouse Space Management System

## 1. Objective

To design and implement an automated system that leverages computer vision to analyze warehouse surveillance footage. The system will detect, quantify, and document empty storage space on racks and shelves, automating the manual process described in the task assignment and providing real-time insights via a dynamic dashboard.

## 2. Our Approach: A Computer Vision Pipeline

We will build a machine learning pipeline that processes video feeds to identify and classify storage slots. Our approach is divided into four main stages:

1.  **Data Preparation:** We will gather and annotate sample images from the warehouse footage to create a custom dataset of "occupied" and "empty" pallet slots.
2.  **Model Training:** We will use an object detection model (like YOLO - You Only Look Once) to train it on our custom dataset. This model will learn to identify the location of each storage slot and classify it as either occupied or empty.
3.  **Inference & Calculation:** The trained model will be used to process the live or recorded video feed. It will scan the footage, count the number of free and occupied slots for each predefined rack, and calculate the available space.
4.  **Reporting & Visualization:** The system will automatically populate a database with the results, generate the required Excel report, and feed data into a web-based dashboard for an intuitive, visual overview of the warehouse capacity.

## 3. Detailed Project Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Data Collection (Day 1)

*   **Task:** Analyze provided surveillance footage to identify suitable camera angles and lighting conditions.
*   **Task:** Extract a diverse set of sample images from the video feeds.
*   **Task:** Annotate (label) these images. We will draw bounding boxes around each pallet slot and assign a class: `empty_slot` or `occupied_slot`.
*   **Tooling:** We will use an annotation tool like `LabelImg` or `CVAT`.

### Phase 2: Model Development & Training (Day 1-2)

*   **Task:** Set up a Python environment with necessary libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV).
*   **Task:** Choose a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv8) as our base. This technique, called transfer learning, will significantly speed up development.
*   **Task:** Train the model on our annotated image dataset.
*   **Task:** Evaluate the model's accuracy and fine-tune it until it reliably detects and classifies slots.

### Phase 3: System Integration & Automation (Day 3-4)

*   **Task:** Develop the core application script that:
    1.  Reads the video stream frame-by-frame.
    2.  Performs inference using our trained model to get bounding boxes and labels.
    3.  Maps detected slots to their physical Aisle/Rack ID. (This may require an initial one-time configuration to map camera regions to physical locations).
    4.  Aggregates the counts of empty and occupied slots.
*   **Task:** Implement logic to handle partial occupancies and other special cases noted in the task description.

### Phase 4: Backend, Reporting & Dashboard (Day 4-5)

*   **Task:** Set up a simple database (like SQLite or a cloud-based one) to store the occupancy data over time.
*   **Task:** Create a function to export the data into the specified Excel format, matching the required columns.
*   **Task:** Develop a simple backend server (e.g., using Flask) to serve the data.
*   **Task:** Connect the backend to the `dashboard.html` to create a dynamic and interactive web interface, showing a real-time visual representation of warehouse capacity.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
*   **Machine Learning:** PyTorch (with YOLOv8) or TensorFlow
*   **Web Framework (for Dashboard):** Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 5. Deliverables

In addition to the requirements in `task.md`, we will deliver:

1.  A fully automated data pipeline from video to data.
2.  A trained and saved custom computer vision model file.
3.  A dynamic web dashboard for real-time monitoring.
4.  All source code and documentation for the project.

This plan ensures we not only meet but exceed the requirements of the task by delivering a scalable and modern solution. Let's get started!
