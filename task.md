# Task: Warehouse Free Space Measurement & Documentation

## Objective:
To determine available storage capacity by systematically measuring and recording empty spaces in the warehouse using video analysis and Excel documentation.

## Work Procedure:
1.  **Video Analysis:**
    *   Review warehouse surveillance footage to identify unoccupied spaces
    *   Focus on:
        *   Main racks (each holding 3 pallets)
        *   Small shelves (for smaller items)
2.  **Space Measurement:**
    *   Calculate empty area (in square meters or pallet slots)
    *   Record partially occupied racks (e.g., 1 empty slot out of 3)
    *   Note any obstructions or special cases
3.  **Excel Documentation:**
    *   Maintain a structured table with these columns:
        *   **Aisle Number**
        *   **Rack/Shelf ID**
        *   **Total Capacity** (e.g., 3 pallets per rack)
        *   **Occupied Space**
        *   **Free Space** (calculated)
        *   **Notes** (e.g., "Partially blocked", "Damaged rack")
4.  **Quality Control:**
    *   Verify video observations with physical spot checks when needed
    *   Ensure measurement consistency (same units throughout)
    *   Cross-validate data entries

## Deliverables:
*   Updated Excel spreadsheet showing:
    *   Free space per aisle and rack
    *   Storage capacity overview
    *   Exception cases

## Special Requirements:
*   Attention to detail in space measurement
*   Ability to analyze video footage accurately
*   Basic Excel skills for data entry
